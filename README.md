Overview In this project: The objective of the project was to create and bring the Kanban Task management app to life by identifying and fixing bugs, and developing functions to extend the capabilities of the application focusing on the key functions such as importing utility functions, initializing data, setting up data correctly in local storage, dynamically displaying boards and tasks and to enhance user interactions. 

Reflections Styling Elements: I was able to style the application according to the brief, to set up the different themes, to create a functioning sidebar, to create tasks and store them in the local storage.

Mastery Areas: The usage of Javascript to achieve the given tasks.

Challenges Faced: I struggled with setting different themes, when I deleted a task, the theme was also changed.

Areas for Improvement: I still need to get comfortable with JavaScript functions, booleans and event listeners.

Code Optimization: I think I have achieved the objective, I need to improve my readability and understanding of the code more.

Creative Design Choices: I think I have adhered to the project objectives, I would like to use my skills and experience to build more responsive applications and also work on personal projects. 

Overall Learning Experience I have enjoyed debugging the bugs, adding other features and making it customer-friendly, the skills, the new experience, and observing each functioning of different functions coming together was nice to observe. And in future, I would honestly like to build more projects that are similar to this one.
